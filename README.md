<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">My journey into coding began through my work as a service technician, where problem-solving and technical precision were part of my everyday tasks. Over time, I realized that programming allows me to use the same mindset – analyzing problems, fixing them, and improving systems – but in a creative and scalable way.  <br><br>I am passionate about web development because it combines logic with creativity: writing clean, structured code on one hand, and building user-friendly, engaging applications on the other. What excites me most is the opportunity to turn ideas into working solutions that others can use and benefit from.  <br><br>Currently, I am expanding my skills in both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I’m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, TypeScript, and responsive design techniques. On the backend side, I’m diving into Python with Django, RESTful APIs, authentication and authorization, database management (PostgreSQL, Redis), as well as DevOps practices like CI/CD and cloud hosting. I am also building knowledge in IT security, testing, and performance optimization to create reliable and secure applications.  <br><br>My source of inspiration is the constant learning process itself: each new project brings fresh challenges and opportunities to grow. I love experimenting, improving with every iteration, and keeping up to date with modern technologies and best practices.  <br><br>For me, coding is more than just a skill – it’s a way to solve problems, create meaningful tools, and continuously challenge myself. My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer who can design, build, and maintain complete web applications, while staying curious and open to whatever new technologies the future brings.</p>
